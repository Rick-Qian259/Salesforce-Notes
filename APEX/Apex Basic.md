### APEX
#### What is Apex: 
- **Hosted:** Apex is saved, compiled, and executed on the serverâ€”the Lightning Platform.
- **Object oriented:** Apex supports classes, interfaces, and inheritance.
- **Strongly typed:** Apex validates references to objects at compile time.
- **Integrated with the database:** It is straightforward to access and manipulate records. 
Apex provides direct access to records and their fields, and provides statements 
and query languages to manipulate those records.
- **Data focused:** Apex provides transactional access to the database, allowing you to roll back operations.
- **Easy to use:** Apex is based on familiar Java idioms.
- **Easy to test:** Apex provides built-in support for unit test creation, execution, and code coverage. Salesforce ensures that all custom Apex code works as expected by executing all unit tests prior to any platform upgrades.
- **Versioned:** Custom Apex code can be saved against different versions of the API.<br>
